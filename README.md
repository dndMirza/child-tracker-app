# Child Tracker App
Collaborated in an Agile/Scrum team to develop a comprehensive desktop application in Java for tracking child health metrics, including feeding, sleep, growth, and medications.

## My Contribution
Led the design and implementation of the graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing, creating intuitive and functional screens for user login, registration, and the main user/child profile pages.

Contributed to sprint planning and backlog refinement by translating high-level requirements from the project specification into actionable user stories in Jira.

Drove front-end and back-end integration, successfully resolving UI alignment issues and debugging a teammate's module to ensure seamless data flow between components.

Utilized Git for version control in a team setting, managing feature branches, merging code, and resolving conflicts to maintain a stable master branch.

## Technologies
Java, Java Swing (JFrame, JPanel), Git, Jira, Agile/Scrum Methodologies.
